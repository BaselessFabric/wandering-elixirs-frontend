                        I am a healer constantly in training. Working with the
                        fungi and plants and resources available to me. I am not
                        a medical professional and should in no way my words or
                        products be used or referred to in place of professional
                        medical advice and treatment. I work with organic
                        systems of growth, harvest and extraction, to create
                        folk-elixirs from safe mushrooms and plants intended to
                        be taken as food supplements alongside a healthy diet
                        and lifestyle. Everything I write is my own copyright

                        resources and is accessible online. I am dedicated to
                        providing accessible, affordable, and ethical products
                        that make a difference Please do your own research for
